next.js@13.2.4

# Next.js
Next is a full-stack web framework, build on top of React and other modern software from both the JS ecosystem and from other technologies.
- Provides us with ready to use web framework, configured with JS, TS, React (with SSR, SSG and Server Components), standardized routing and other very hard to setup modern tooling.
- Opinionated, as after years of building apps with React, leading opinions and conventions were formed in the community and Next.js as a framework incorporates those ideas.

This thing is currently on "meta" and is the strongest pick! ... it won't be nerfed soon, only buffed and we all know how this works out now, don't we?

##### Create a Next.js app
run `npx create-next-app@latest`
run `npx create-next-app@latest .` to create the app in the current folder.

The command will bootstrap an app for you and configure some settings for you, so it will ask you the following questions:
- Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? » No / Yes
- Would you like to use ESLint with this project? » No / Yes
- Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? » No / Yes
- Would you like to use experimental `app/` directory with this project? » No / Yes
- What import alias would you like configured? » @/*

Let's name our app, answer `yes` to all and use `@/*` for import alias.

#### 2. Routing
Next.js has a file-system based router built on the concept of pages, where each page is just a `React Component`, each page must be named `page.[js|jsx|ts|tsx]` and each route is strictly mapped to a page, based on it's directory name.

Personal Opinion: The idea is to probably have a standardized way of routing, which promises to be efficient, but for now, I see a lot of problems, like:
- Duplicate files, duplicate names and it doesn't really matter how you name your functions.
- We are back in the old days bois, you can't use any `architectural patterns` like `MVC (folder-by-type, folder-by-feature or hybrid)` and you are stuck with app based on the folder structure.

##### 2.1. `App` Directory
The **app/** directory introduces support for React's new Server Components architecture and is considered the **root folder** in the context of defining routes.

##### 2.2. Defining Routes
You can use the folder hierarchy inside app to define routes. A **route** is a single path of nested folders, following the hierarchy from the **root folder** down to a final **leaf folder**.

With this system, you'll use folders to define routes, and files to define UI. (few filenames are reserved, e.g., `page`, `layout` and `loading`)

Let's have the following hierarchy:
```
-src
--app
---page.jsx
---auth
----login
-----page.js
----register
-----page.js
```

In the above example, we have the following mapping between **URL** and **Files**

| URL             | File                              |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `/`             | `/src/app/page.jsx`               |
| `/auth/login`   | `/src/app/auth/login/page.jsx`    |
| `/auth/register`| `/src/app/auth/register/page.jsx` |
