# Web Service Layer

## Evolution

### The Early Days: Traditional Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

In the early days of web development, server-side rendering was the standard approach. When a user made a request, the server would process the request, build the entire HTML document on the server side, and then send this complete document back to the client's browser.

**Example Workflow**

- **Request:** The user clicks a link or submits a form.
- **Server Processing:** The server (PHP) processes the request, retrieves data from a database (MySQL), and uses a rendering engine (Blade) to generate the HTML content.
- **Response:** The server sends the fully rendered HTML document to the client's browser.
- **Client Processing (Full Reload):** The browser replaces the current document with the new one, causing a full page reload.

This process was straightforward but had limitations:

- **Full Page Reloads:** Each user action requiring data from the server resulted in a full page reload, which was slow and disrupted the user experience.
- **High Server Load:** Servers had to render the entire page, processing all recourses for the page again and again, for every request, which is resource-intensive.

### AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)

With the introduction of AJAX in the mid-2000s, web development underwent a significant transformation. Ajax allowed web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This meant parts of a web page could be updated without reloading the entire page.

**History**

- **1999:** Introduction of XMLHttpRequest by Microsoft.
- **2005:** Jesse James Garrett popularizes the term "Ajax."
- **2005:** Google demonstrated the potential of Ajax with Google Maps, leading to widespread interest.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Partial Page Updates:** Each user action required only specific parts of data from the server, which caused only specific parts of the web page to be updated, leading to a faster and smoother user experience.
- **Asynchronous Requests:** Using the new XHR (XMLHttpRequest) object, JavaScript could send multiple asynchronous requests to the server at the same time, without blocking the user interface. The server would then process the requests and return multiple responses, JavaScript would then handle the responses and update only a specific part of the page. Before AJAX, this was impossible.
- **Standardized Data Transport**: Initially, XML (eXtensible Markup Language) was the standard format for data exchange and it provided a structured way to represent data but was verbose and complex. Over time, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) became the preferred format due to its lightweight, easy-to-read, and easy-to-parse nature. JSON is more efficient and integrates seamlessly with JavaScript, making it ideal for web applications.

**Example Workflow**

- **User Action:** The user performs an action (e.g., clicking a button).
- **Request (with XHR):** JavaScript creates an `XMLHttpRequest` object and sends a request to the server.
- **Server Processing:** The server (PHP) processes the request, retrieves data from a database (MySQL), but does not start building the entire HTML page, instead it prepares a small response
- **Response (with JSON):** The server sends only a specific chunk of data in JSON format.
- **Client Processing (Partial Update):** JavaScript receives the JSON response and updates the relevant part of the web page without reloading the entire page.

### 2020: Modern Data Fetching and State Management

Many tools started to appear, build on top of `Fetch API` to provide powerful capabilities for data fetching, caching, synchronization and more. These tools abstract away much of the boilerplate code associated with data fetching and state management, making it easier for developers to make `REST` calls and manage server state.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Data Fetching and Management:** simplify data fetching and management in Single-Page Applications (SPA), providing hooks that handle complex logic with minimal code.
- **Lower Complexity:** reduce the amount of code and complexity required to manage server state, making it easier for developers to build and maintain applications.
