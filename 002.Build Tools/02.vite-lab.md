### III. Vite

#### 1. Intro

##### What is Vite?

**Vite** is a build tool.

#### 2. Webpack Basics

##### 2.1. Setup

##### 2.2. CSS
There are several things, enabled by default
- CSS Files Import/Export
- CSS Modules

Others are easy to enable
- Source Maps
- CSS Preprocessors
    - SASS (incl. SASS Modules)

**Source Maps**
By default you are not able to inspect from which file a specific CSS style is applied. You need to enable source maps, which is done by adding the following line in your configuration file **vite.config.js**
```diff
export default defineConfig({
+   css: {
+       devSourcemap: true
+   }
});
```

**CSS Preprocessors/SASS**
Step 1: To enable SASS, run `npm install -D sass`
Step 2: navigate to `./src/components/MovieCardComponent` and create a `MovieCardComponent.scss` with the following content:
```scss
.MovieCardComponent {
    border: 1px solid black;
    padding: 10px;
    &:hover {
        background-color: wheat;
    }
}
```
Step 3: Import the `MovieCardComponent.scss` file in `./src/components/MovieCardComponent/MovieCardComponent.jsx` and test it out.
