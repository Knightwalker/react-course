# React Course

**React Course** is a course project for teaching in-depth **React** and adjacent ecosystem technologies. This repo ultimately aims to compile all lectures, labs and exercises, being teached by me on the covered technologies. The covered technologies are several, but the focus remains on **React**, in attempt to learn the technology in-depth.
